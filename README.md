Rust Cheatsheet
===============

[A HTML, still growing, extensive Rust cheatsheet](http://phaiax.github.io/rust-cheatsheet/).

This cheatsheet is more about the standard library than about language features.

# Contribute

 * make a pull request as soon as possible (it's only one file, so merge conflicts are probable)

 * keep html clean, use the style provided.
 * improve or change design if you are a good designer (i'm not)
